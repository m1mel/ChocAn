Members pay a monthly fee to ChocAn.  

For this fee they are entitled to unlimited consultations and treatments 
with health care professionals, namely, dietitians, internists, and exercise specialists.

When a provider’s terminal is switched on, the provider is asked to enter his or her provider number. 

To receive health care services from ChocAn, the member hands his or her card to the provider, who slides the card through the card reader on the terminal.  
The terminal then dials the ChocAn Data Center, and the ChocAn Data Center computer verifies the member number.  

If the number is valid, the word Validated appears on the one-line display.  If the number is not valid, 
the reason is displayed, such as Invalid Number or Member suspended; the latter message indicated that fees are owed 
(that is, the member has not paid membership fees for at least a month) and member status has been set to suspended.  

To bill ChocAn after a health care service has been provided to the member, 
the provider again passes the card through the card reader (or keys in the member 
number).

When the word Validated appears, the provider keys in the date the 
service was provided in the format MM-DD-YYYY.

Next, the provider uses the Provider Directory to look up the appropriate six-digit service code corresponding 
to the service provided.  For example, 598470 is the code for a session with a 
dietitian, whereas 883948 is the code for an aerobics exercise session.The provider 
then keys in the service code.  

To check that the service code has been correctly looked up and keyed in, the software product then displays the name of the service 
corresponding to the code (up to 20 characters) and asks the provider to verify that 
this is indeed the service that was provided.  

If the provider has entered a nonexistent code, an error message is printed.  The provider also can enter 
comments about the service provided. 

The software product now writes a record to disk that includes the following 
fields: 
• Current date and time (MM-DD-YYYY HH:MM:SS). 
• Date service was provided (MM-DD-YYYY). 
• Provider number (9 digits). 
• Member number (9 digits). 
• Service code (6 digits). 
• Comments (100 characters) (optional). 

The software product next looks up the fee to be paid for that service and displays it 
on the provider’s terminal.For verification purposes, the provider has a form on 
which to enter the current date and time, the date the service was provide, member 
name and number, service code, and fee to be paid.  At the end of the week, the 
provider totals the fees to verify the amount to be paid to that provider by ChocAn 
for that week. 

At any time, a provider can request the software product for a Provider 
Directory, an alphabetically ordered list of service names and corresponding service 
codes and fees.  The Provider Directory is sent to the provider as an e-mail 
attachment. 

At midnight on Friday, the main accounting procedure is run at the ChocAn 
Data Center.It reads the week’s file of services provided and prints a number of 
reports.Each report also can be run individually at the request of a ChocAn 
manager at any time during the week. 

Each member who has consulted a ChocAn provider during that week 
receives a list of services provided to that member, sorted in order of service date.  
The report, which is also sent as an e-mail attachment, includes: 
• Member name (25 characters). 
• Member number (9 digits). 
• Member street address (25 characters). 
• Member city (14 characters). 
• Member state (2 letters). 
• Member zip code (5 digits). 
• For each service provided, the following details are required: 
o Date of service (MM-DD-YYYY). 
o Provider name (25 characters). 
o Service name (20 characters). 

Each provider who has billed ChocAn during that week receives a report, 
sent as an e-mail attachment, containing the list of services he or she provided to 
ChocAn members. To simplify the task of verification, the report contains the same 
information as that entered on the provider’s form, in the order that the data were 
received by the computer. At the end of the report is a summary including the 
number of consultations with members and the total fee for that week. That is, the 
fields of the report include: 
• Provider name (25 characters). 
• Provider number (9 digits). 
• Provider street address (25 characters). 
• Provider city (14 characters). 
• Provider state (2 letters). 
• Provider zip code (5 digits). 
• For each service provided, the following details are required: 
o Date of service (MM-DD-YYYY). 
o Date and time data were received by the computer (MM-DD-YYYY 
HH:MM:SS). 
o Member name (25 characters). 
o Member number (9 digits). 
o Service code (6 digits). 
o Fee to be paid (up to $999.99). 
• Total number of consultations with members (3 digits). 
• Total fee for the week (up to $99,999.99). 

A record consisting of electronic funds transfer (EFT) data is then written to 
disk; banking computers will later ensure that each provider’s bank account is 
credited with the appropriate amount. 

  A summary report is given to the manager for accounts payable.  The report 
lists every provider to be paid that week, the number of consultations each had, and 
his or her total fee for that week.  Finally the total number of providers who 
provided services, the total number of consultations, and the overall fee total are 
printed. 

  During the day, the software at the ChocAn Data Center is run in interactive 
mode to allow operators to add new members to ChocAn, to delete members who 
have resigned, and to update member records.  Similarly, provider records are 
added, deleted, and updated. 

  The processing of payments of ChocAn membership fees has been contracted 
out to Acme Accounting Services, a third-party organization.  Acme is responsible 
for financial procedures such as recording payments of membership fees, 
suspending members whose fees are overdue, and reinstating suspended members 
who have now paid what was owed.  The Acme computer updates the relevant 
ChocAn Data Center membership records each evening at 9 P.M. 

  Your organization has been awarded the contract to write only the ChocAn 
data processing software; another organization will be responsible for the 
communications software, for designing the ChocAn provider’s terminal, for the 
software needed by Acme Accounting Services, and for implementing the EFT 
component.  The contract states that, at the acceptance test, the data from a 
provider’s terminal must be simulated by keyboard input and data to be transmitted 
to a provider’s terminal display must appear on the screen.  A manager’s terminal 
must be simulated by the same keyboard and screen.  Each member report must be 
written to its own file; the name of the file should begin with the member name 
followed by the date of the report.  The provider reports should be handled in the 
same way.  The Provider Directory must also be created as a file.  None of the files 
should actually be sent as e-mail attachments.  As for the EFT data, all that is 
required is that a file be set up containing the provider name, provider number, and 
the amount to be transferred.
